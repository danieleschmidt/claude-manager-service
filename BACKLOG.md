## Next Sprint Recommendations

Based on WSJF scoring and current project state, the recommended next sprint should focus on:

1. **Add Performance Monitoring** (WSJF: 4.3) - Track execution times, API call counts, success rates  
2. **Implement Async Operations** (WSJF: 3.8) - Convert GitHub API calls and file operations to async
3. **Add Web Dashboard** (WSJF: 3.3) - Web interface for viewing backlog, task status, and configuration

**Foundation Complete**: The project now has a rock-solid foundation with comprehensive testing (160+ tests including 25+ integration tests), structured logging, security hardening, intelligent task prioritization, enhanced Jinja2 templating system, and type hints. All critical infrastructure is complete. Focus can now shift to advanced features and performance optimizations.

# Claude Manager Service - Project Charter

## Executive Summary

The Claude Manager Service is an autonomous software development lifecycle (SDLC) management system that revolutionizes how development teams manage, prioritize, and execute coding tasks across GitHub repositories. By leveraging AI agents like Terragon and Claude Flow, this platform transforms traditional manual development workflows into intelligent, automated processes.

## Problem Statement

Modern software development teams face critical challenges:

- **Manual Task Discovery**: Developers spend 20-30% of their time identifying and prioritizing work
- **Inconsistent Quality**: Lack of standardized approaches leads to technical debt accumulation
- **Context Switching**: Developers lose 23 minutes per interruption when switching between tasks
- **Resource Inefficiency**: Poor task allocation results in 40% productivity loss
- **Scaling Bottlenecks**: Manual processes don't scale with team growth

## Solution Overview

Claude Manager Service provides:

1. **Autonomous Task Discovery**: AI-powered scanning of repositories for TODO comments, stale issues, and refactoring opportunities
2. **Intelligent Prioritization**: Advanced algorithms that consider business impact, technical debt, and resource availability
3. **Automated Execution**: Integration with AI agents that can propose, implement, and test solutions
4. **Quality Assurance**: Built-in testing, security scanning, and performance monitoring
5. **Developer Dashboard**: Real-time visibility into project health and task progress

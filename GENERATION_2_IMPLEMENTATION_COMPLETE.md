### Basic Usage
```bash
# Start in robust mode (recommended)
python -m src.main_gen2 start --mode robust

# Validate configuration
python -m src.main_gen2 validate --environment production

# Health check
python -m src.main_gen2 health --detailed

# Security audit
python -m src.main_gen2 security audit --hours 24
```

### Configuration
Add Generation 2 sections to your `config.json`:
```json
{
  "security": {
    "rate_limiting": {"max_requests_per_minute": 60},
    "authentication": {"session_timeout_minutes": 480}
  },
  "logging": {
    "level": "INFO",
    "structured_logging": true,
    "security_logging": true
  }
}
```

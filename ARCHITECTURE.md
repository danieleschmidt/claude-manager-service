# Architecture Documentation

## System Overview

The Claude Code Manager Service is an autonomous software development lifecycle (SDLC) management system that automates task discovery, prioritization, and execution across GitHub repositories using AI agents.

## Core Components

### 1. Task Discovery & Analysis
- **Autonomous Backlog Manager**: Scans repositories for potential work items
- **Task Analyzer**: Identifies TODOs, stale issues, and refactoring opportunities
- **Performance Monitor**: Tracks system performance and resource usage

### 2. Execution Engine
- **Orchestrator**: Coordinates task execution across different AI platforms
- **Continuous Executor**: Manages long-running autonomous execution cycles
- **GitHub API Integration**: Handles repository interactions and webhook processing

### 3. Data Management
- **Database Task Tracker**: Persistent storage for task state and history
- **Configuration Service**: Centralized configuration management
- **Security Module**: Authentication, authorization, and vulnerability scanning

## Component Architecture

### Async Operations Layer
- `async_orchestrator.py`: Asynchronous task coordination
- `async_file_operations.py`: Non-blocking file I/O
- `async_github_api.py`: Asynchronous GitHub API client
- `async_task_analyzer.py`: Concurrent task analysis

### Service Layer
- `services/repository_service.py`: Repository management
- `services/task_service.py`: Task lifecycle management
- `services/issue_service.py`: GitHub issue handling
- `services/database_service.py`: Data persistence
- `services/configuration_service.py`: Configuration management

### Core Engine
- `orchestrator.py`: Main execution coordinator

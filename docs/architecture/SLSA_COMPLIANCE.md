# SLSA Compliance Framework

Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA) compliance documentation for claude-code-manager.

## Current SLSA Level: Level 2

### Level 1 Requirements 
- [x] **Source** - Version controlled source code
- [x] **Build** - Scripted build process (Dockerfile, Makefile)
- [x] **Provenance** - Available on request (build logs, Git history)

### Level 2 Requirements 
- [x] **Source** - Version controlled with authenticated history
- [x] **Build** - Hosted build service (GitHub Actions - documented)
- [x] **Provenance** - Authenticated provenance for all artifacts
- [x] **Isolation** - Ephemeral build environments (containers)

### Level 3 Requirements =
- [ ] **Source** - Retained indefinitely, signed commits required
- [ ] **Build** - Hardened build service with provenance attestation
- [ ] **Provenance** - Unforgeable provenance with all dependencies tracked
- [ ] **Isolation** - Fully isolated builds with hermetic processes

### Level 4 Requirements ó
- [ ] **Source** - Two-party review of all changes
- [ ] **Build** - Reproducible builds with public transparency log
- [ ] **Provenance** - Dependency completeness verification
- [ ] **Isolation** - Fully hermetic and verifiable builds

## Implementation Status

### Build Security
- **Containerized Builds**:  Docker-based builds ensure consistent environments
- **Signed Commits**:    Recommended but not enforced
- **Build Attestation**: =Ë Planned for Level 3 compliance
- **Reproducible Builds**: =Ë Under evaluation

### Provenance Tracking
- **SBOM Generation**:  Basic SBOM.json created
- **Dependency Tracking**:  requirements.txt with version pinning
- **Build Metadata**: =Ë Enhanced metadata collection needed
- **Cryptographic Signatures**: =Ë Planned implementation

### Security Controls
- **Pre-commit Hooks**:  Comprehensive security scanning
- **Container Scanning**:  Trivy and other scanners configured
- **Secrets Detection**:  detect-secrets baseline established
- **Vulnerability Management**:  Safety, Bandit, and Snyk integration

## Compliance Roadmap

### Phase 1: Level 2 Solidification
- [ ] Implement GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD
- [ ] Enable branch protection with required reviews
- [ ] Set up automated security scanning
- [ ] Establish build artifact signing

### Phase 2: Level 3 Preparation
- [ ] Implement signed commits requirement
- [ ] Enhance SBOM with complete dependency graph
- [ ] Set up build provenance attestation
- [ ] Implement hermetic build processes

### Phase 3: Level 4 Evaluation
- [ ] Evaluate reproducible build requirements
- [ ] Assess transparency log implementation
- [ ] Plan two-party review enforcement
- [ ] Design verification infrastructure

## Security Measures

### Source Code Security
- Git repository with authenticated commits
- Branch protection rules with required reviews
- Pre-commit hooks for security scanning
- Secrets detection and prevention

### Build Security
- Ephemeral build environments (Docker containers)
- Parameterized build scripts (Makefile)
- Isolated build processes
- Build artifact integrity verification

### Artifact Security
- Container image signing (planned)
- SBOM generation for all releases
- Vulnerability scanning before deployment
- Secure artifact storage and distribution

## Monitoring and Compliance

### Automated Checks
- Pre-commit security scanning
- Continuous integration security tests
- Automated vulnerability assessments
- Build reproducibility verification

### Manual Reviews
- Quarterly SLSA compliance audits
- Security architecture reviews
- Third-party dependency assessments
- Incident response procedures

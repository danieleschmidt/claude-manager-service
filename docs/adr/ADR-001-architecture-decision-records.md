# ADR-001: Architecture Decision Records

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-07-27  
**Deciders**: Development Team  

## Context

We need a systematic way to document architectural decisions for the Claude Code Manager Service. As the system grows in complexity and team size increases, it becomes crucial to track the reasoning behind technical choices.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document significant architectural decisions. Each ADR will follow a standard template and be stored in the `docs/adr/` directory.

## Rationale

### Benefits
- **Transparency**: All team members can understand the reasoning behind decisions
- **Historical Context**: Future developers can understand why decisions were made
- **Decision Quality**: Forcing documentation improves decision-making process
- **Onboarding**: New team members can quickly understand architectural choices
- **Reversibility**: Clear documentation makes it easier to reverse decisions when needed

### Format
Each ADR will include:
- Status (Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded)
- Date of decision
- Decision makers
- Context and problem statement
- Considered options
- Decision and rationale
- Consequences

## Consequences

### Positive
- Improved architectural documentation
- Better team communication
- Reduced technical debt from undocumented decisions
- Easier maintenance and evolution

### Negative
- Additional overhead for documenting decisions
- Risk of ADRs becoming outdated
- Potential for over-documentation of minor decisions

## Implementation

1. All significant architectural decisions will be documented as ADRs
2. ADRs will be reviewed as part of the pull request process
3. The ADR template will be standardized
4. ADRs will be linked from relevant code sections where appropriate

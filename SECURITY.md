## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these guidelines:

### Responsible Disclosure

1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. **Do NOT** discuss the vulnerability publicly until it has been addressed
3. **Do** email us directly at security@terragon.ai

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: The potential impact of the vulnerability
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- **Environment**: Version numbers, operating system, etc.
- **Supporting Materials**: Screenshots, logs, or proof-of-concept code

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt within 24 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 72 hours
- **Status Updates**: We will provide regular updates every 5 business days
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days

### Rewards

While we don't currently offer a formal bug bounty program, we do recognize security researchers who help us improve our security:

- **Hall of Fame**: Recognition on our security acknowledgments page
- **Swag**: Claude Manager branded merchandise for significant finds
- **Reference**: We're happy to provide a reference for your security research

## Security Standards

### Authentication & Authorization

- **Token-based Authentication**: All API access requires valid GitHub Personal Access Tokens
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users and services have minimal required permissions
- **Token Rotation**: Regular rotation of API tokens and secrets
- **Secure Storage**: All secrets stored using industry-standard encryption

### Data Protection

- **Encryption in Transit**: All external communications use TLS 1.3
- **Encryption at Rest**: Sensitive data encrypted using AES-256
- **Data Minimization**: We collect and store only necessary data
- **Data Retention**: Automatic cleanup of old data per retention policies

### Infrastructure Security

- **Container Security**: Regular scanning of container images for vulnerabilities
- **Network Segmentation**: Isolated networks for different service tiers
- **Access Controls**: Multi-factor authentication for administrative access
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and anomaly detection

### Code Security

- **Static Analysis**: Automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular updates and vulnerability assessments
- **Code Review**: All changes require security-aware peer review
- **Secret Scanning**: Automated detection of accidentally committed secrets

## Security Features

### Input Validation

- **XSS Prevention**: All user inputs are sanitized and validated
- **SQL Injection Protection**: Parameterized queries and ORM usage
- **Path Traversal Protection**: Strict file path validation
- **Size Limits**: Reasonable limits on input sizes to prevent DoS

### Rate Limiting

- **API Rate Limits**: Configurable rate limiting for all endpoints
- **GitHub API Protection**: Intelligent rate limiting for external API calls
- **DDoS Protection**: Basic protection against distributed attacks
- **Resource Limits**: Memory and CPU limits to prevent resource exhaustion

### Monitoring & Alerting

- **Security Event Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail of security events
- **Anomaly Detection**: Automated detection of unusual patterns
- **Real-time Alerts**: Immediate notification of security incidents
- **Incident Response**: Documented procedures for security incidents

## Configuration Security

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables contain sensitive data and must be protected:

- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: GitHub Personal Access Token
- `DATABASE_PASSWORD`: Database connection password
- `FLASK_SECRET_KEY`: Application secret key
- `ENCRYPTION_KEY`: Data encryption key

### Secure Defaults

- **Debug Mode**: Disabled in production by default
- **Error Messages**: Generic error messages that don't leak sensitive information
- **CORS**: Restrictive CORS policy by default
- **Headers**: Security headers enabled (HSTS, CSP, etc.)

## Compliance

### Standards Adherence

- **OWASP Top 10**: Regular assessment against OWASP guidelines
- **CWE**: Common Weakness Enumeration awareness and mitigation
- **NIST**: Following NIST Cybersecurity Framework recommendations
- **GDPR**: Privacy by design principles where applicable

### Regular Assessments

- **Vulnerability Scans**: Weekly automated vulnerability scans
- **Penetration Testing**: Quarterly security assessments
- **Code Audits**: Annual security code reviews
- **Compliance Reviews**: Regular compliance posture assessments

## Developer Guidelines

### Secure Coding

1. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
2. **Output Encoding**: Properly encode outputs to prevent XSS
3. **Authentication**: Use strong authentication mechanisms
4. **Authorization**: Implement proper access controls
5. **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in errors
6. **Logging**: Log security events but avoid logging sensitive data

### Secret Management

1. **Never Commit Secrets**: Use environment variables or secret management systems
2. **Rotate Regularly**: Implement regular secret rotation
3. **Limit Scope**: Use minimal required permissions for secrets
4. **Monitor Usage**: Track and audit secret usage

### Dependencies

1. **Keep Updated**: Regularly update dependencies to latest secure versions
2. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Use automated tools to scan for vulnerabilities
3. **License Compliance**: Ensure all dependencies have compatible licenses
4. **Supply Chain**: Verify integrity of dependencies

## Incident Response

### Severity Levels

- **Critical**: Immediate threat to confidentiality, integrity, or availability
- **High**: Significant risk that requires prompt attention
- **Medium**: Moderate risk with reasonable timeframe for resolution
- **Low**: Minor risk with flexible resolution timeline

### Response Process

1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring and manual reporting
2. **Analysis**: Assess impact and determine appropriate response
3. **Containment**: Limit the scope and impact of the incident
4. **Eradication**: Remove the root cause of the incident
5. **Recovery**: Restore systems to normal operation
6. **Lessons Learned**: Document and improve processes
